## hi, it's lucas! ·v·

i am a ***computer science student*** in mataró (barcelona, spain). i like to create pretty art and things in general, and happen to like computers too, which is why i like programming!

i keep ***shifting personal projects*** as i feel like. i like to learn new stuff and apply it.

i don't really have an area i specialize in yet: i developed using the technologies i required for my personal projects, including ***web development*** with html+css+js, and ***mobile development*** with swift and kotlin, among others.

### some things i made:
* a twitch chat archive and replay tool, [chatrewind](https://github.com/soywig/chatrewind).
* a music-specialized jellyfin client for ios, jellisten.
* a quick qr creating website, [qrnocrap](https://qrnocrap.github.io).
* a draw-chat app on lan, [pctochat](https://github.com/soywig/pctochat).
