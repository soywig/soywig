## hi, this is lucas! ·v·

i am a ***computer science student*** in mataró (barcelona, spain). i like video games, creating pretty art and things in general, and happen to like computers too, which is why i enjoy programming!

in my free time, i keep ***shifting personal projects*** based on my mood. i like learning new stuff and applying it.

there's not really an area i specialize in yet. i’ve built things using whatever technologies my personal projects required, including ***web development*** (html, css, js) and ***mobile development*** with swift and kotlin, among others.

### some things i made:
* 💬 a twitch chat archive and replay tool, [chatrewind](https://github.com/soywig/chatrewind).
* 🎧 a music-specialized jellyfin client for iOS, jellisten.
* 📱 a quick qr creating website, [qrnocrap](https://qrnocrap.github.io).
* 🎨 a draw-chat app on lan, [pctochat](https://github.com/soywig/pctochat).
